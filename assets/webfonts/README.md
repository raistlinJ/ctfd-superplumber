# Mario Font Assets

This folder stores the Mario Maker font files downloaded from https://github.com/yell0wsuit/MARIOFont.

Because the font belongs to Nintendo, the files themselves are not committed. Run `yarn fetch:mario-font` (or execute `node scripts/fetch-mario-font.js`) to download the latest copies into this directory before building.
